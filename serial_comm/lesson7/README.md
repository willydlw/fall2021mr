# Arduino Serial.readByteUntil

## Purpose 

Experiment with Serial.readBytesUntil to fully understand how this function behaves amd makeit work for your purpose.

Try the following experiments

1. Use the Serial monitor program to send different messages.

2. Wait more than 1 second to send a message to see that the function times out.

3. Send a message that is only 2 characters long, terminated by the newline character to see that only 2 characters are read.
