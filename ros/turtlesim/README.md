# Turtlesim - ROS robot simulation

Turtlesim is a tool made for teaching ROS and ROS packages. The simulation consists of a graphical window that shows a turtle-shaped robot. The background color for the turtle's world can be changed using the Parameter Server. The turtle can be moved around on the screen by ROS commands or using the keyboard.
