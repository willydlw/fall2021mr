# Lesson 6 - python lists

A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].

A list is not the same as an array, as arrays contain objects of the same data type. Python does not have built-in support for arrays. In a later lesson, we will learn how to use the numpy library for arrays.

## lesson6a.py - Getting started with lists

- Create a list that contains string data types. 
- Print the object's data type. 
- Print the list contents

Lists may be constructed in several ways. The example below creates a list using square brackets, separating items with commas: [a, b, c]

```python
# create a list that contains string data types
school_supplies = ['pencil', 'paper', 'glue', 'calculator', 'notebook']

# what is the school_supplies data type?
print("type(school_supplies) ", type(school_supplies))

# print all items in the list
print(school_supplies)
```

</br>

**output**

```
type(school_supplies)  <class 'list'>
['pencil', 'paper', 'glue', 'calculator', 'notebook']
```

</br>

Each item in a list corresponds to an index number, which is an integer value, starting with the index number 0.

For the list school_supplies, the index breakdown looks like this:
| 'pencil' | 'paper' | 'glue' | 'calculator' | 'notebook' |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |


The first item, the string 'pencil' starts at index 0, and the list ends at index 4 with the item 'notebook'.

Because each item in a Python list has a corresponding index number, weâ€™re able to access and manipulate lists in the same ways we can with other sequential data types.

Now we can access a discrete item of the list by referring to its index number:

```python
# access list items by index number
print("\naccess list item at index 2")
print(school_supplies[2])
school_supplies[2] = 'paste'
print(school_supplies[2])
```

**output**
```
access list item at index 2
glue
paste

```

A for loop can be used to iterate through the list sequence.

```python
for iterating_var in sequence:
   statements(s)
```

s is the iterator variable that provides access to the list item.

```python
# iterate through the list, access each object individually
print("\niterating through list with for loop")
for s in school_supplies:
   print(s)
```

**output**
```
iterating through list with for loop
pencil
paper
paste
calculator
notebook

```

</br></br>

## lesson6b.py - sort list of integers

Python dyanmically types variables. The example below shows the numbers in the list are typed as integers. The list class sort method is used to sort the list in ascending order.

The list data type has several methods. See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html for the available methods of list objects. </br>


```python
# lesson 6b 
#   create a list of integers
#   sort the list

myIntList = [6, 3, 7, -2, -13, 0]
print("original list: ", myIntList)

# iterator through the list one item at a time
# print the list item and its data type
print("\ndata type of each list item")
for v in myIntList:
   print("v: ", v, type(v))


# sort the list
myIntList.sort()
print("\nsorted list: ", myIntList)
```

</br>

**output**
```
original list:  [6, 3, 7, -2, -13, 0]

data type of each list item
v:  6 <class 'int'>
v:  3 <class 'int'>
v:  7 <class 'int'>
v:  -2 <class 'int'>
v:  -13 <class 'int'>
v:  0 <class 'int'>

sorted list:  [-13, -2, 0, 3, 6, 7]
```

</br></br>



## lesson6c.py - list method append

The example below demonstrates creating an empty list and appending items to the end of the list. Experiment with the program to watch the list grow.

```python
# create an empty list
myList = []

# print the number of items in the list and the list contents
print("empty list")
print("len(myList): ", len(myList))
print("myList: ", myList)

dataRead = 1

while dataRead != 'q':
   dataRead = input("\nenter list item or q to quit: ")
   myList.append(dataRead)
   print("len(myList): ", len(myList))
   print("myList: ", myList)
```
