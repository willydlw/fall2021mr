'''
A circular, two-wheeled, differential drive steered robot is to maintain 
a velocity of 1 meter per second. This is the reference point velocity, 
with the reference point located at the center of the circle.

The user inputs a desired radius of curvature. 
Interpret the values as follows.
   Positive values are radius of curvature in meters. This indicates turning to the left.
   Negative values are radius of curvature in meters. This indicates turning to the right. 
   A zero value indicates a zero curvature. Treat this as forward straight-line travel. 
   We know that straight line travel has an infinite radius of curvature, but do not want 
   the user to have to enter -infinity or +infinity.

   Because 0 is used to represent straight-line motion, this program does not support
   turning in place, at a radius of zero, by spinning wheels in opposite directions at
   the same rotational speed.

   Program also does not support radial distances that are less than the radial distance
   from the robot center to each wheel. This is mathematically calculable, but is it 
   physically achievable?


The robotâ€™s width from wheel to wheel is 0.70 meters, with the center reference point 
midway between the wheels. The radius of each wheel is 0.15 meters.

Calculate and print the left-side- and right-side-wheel velocities in units of meters 
per second and rotational velocities in revolutions per second.
