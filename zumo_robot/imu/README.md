# Interial Measurement Unit Sensors

An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a device that measures and reports a body's force, angular rate, and orientation, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. The accelerometers detect linear acceleration. Gyroscopes measure the rotational (angular) rate. Some IMUs include a magnetometer to provide a heading reference. 

<p> This module focuses on the ZumoShield Library examples using the LGD20H and LSM303D sensors as an inertial measurement unit. </p>

## LGD20H Three-Axis Gyroscope 

The L3GD20H is a low-power three-axis angular rate sensor. It includes a sensing element and an IC interface able to provide the measured angular rate to the external world through digital interface (I2C/SPI).

The sensor features a user-programmable gyro full-scale range of ±245, ±500, and ±2000 °/sec (dps).
